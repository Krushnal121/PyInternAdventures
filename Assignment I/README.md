# 02. Lists and Tuples in Python

## **Lists:**

- **Definition:**
  - A **list** in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of elements enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

- **Mutability:**
  - Lists are **mutable**, meaning elements can be added, removed, or modified after the list is created.

- **Syntax:**
  - Example of creating a list: `my_list = [1, 2, 'hello', 3.14]`

- **Methods:**
  - Lists offer various built-in methods like `append()`, `extend()`, and `remove()` for manipulation.

- **Performance:**
  - Lists are slightly slower compared to tuples due to their mutability.

## **Tuples:**

- **Definition:**
  - A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection of elements enclosed in parentheses `()`.

- **Immutability:**
  - Tuples are **immutable**, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed or modified.

- **Syntax:**
  - Example of creating a tuple: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 'hello', 3.14)`

- **Methods:**
  - Tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists, as there are no methods for adding or removing elements.

- **Performance:**
  - Tuples are generally faster than lists due to their immutability.

## **Key Differences:**

| **Aspect**        | **Lists**                  | **Tuples**                |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Mutability**    | Mutable                    | Immutable                |
| **Syntax**        | Square brackets `[]`       | Parentheses `()`          |
| **Methods**       | More methods available     | Fewer methods available  |
| **Performance**   | Slightly slower            | Generally faster         |

### **Usage Guidelines:**

- Use **lists** when you need a collection that can be modified, such as adding or removing elements during program execution.

- Use **tuples** when you want to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental modifications to the elements, providing a more secure and efficient solution for certain scenarios.

## Conclusion:
Understanding the differences between lists and tuples is crucial for choosing the appropriate data structure based on the requirements of a specific task in Python. Lists offer flexibility and mutability, while tuples provide immutability and enhanced performance.

# 03. Common Built-in Data Types in Python

Python supports a variety of built-in data types, each serving a specific purpose in programming. Here are some of the most common ones:

  - Represents **complex** numbers with a real and imaginary part.
  - Example: `z = 2 + 3j`

## 2. **Sequence Types:**

- **str:**
  - Represents **strings** or sequences of characters.
  - Example: `name = 'Python'`

- **list:**
  - Represents **lists**, which are ordered and mutable collections.
  - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`

- **tuple:**
  - Represents **tuples**, which are ordered and immutable collections.
  - Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

## 3. **Set Types:**

- **set:**
  - Represents **sets**, which are unordered and mutable collections of unique elements.
  - Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`

- **frozenset:**
  - Represents **frozensets**, which are similar to sets but immutable.
  - Example: `my_frozenset = frozenset({1, 2, 3})`

## 4. **Mapping Type:**

- **dict:**
  - Represents **dictionaries**, which are key-value pairs and unordered.
  - Example: `my_dict = {'key': 'value'}`

## 5. **Boolean Type:**

- **bool:**
  - Represents **boolean** values (True or False).
